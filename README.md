-   **Node.js**: v20.15.1

## Running Tests

To run all the test suites, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

If you want to run a specific test suite, use:

```bash
npm test <test-suite-name>
```

## Scripts

This repository includes several useful scripts for deploying, upgrading, and managing the core smart contracts. These scripts are located in the `/scripts` directory and can be executed using the [Blueprint CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blueprint).

Example of deploying a smart contract:

```bash
npx blueprint run --mnemonic deploy3TONPool
```

WALLET_VERSION=v4
NETWORK=testnet # or mainnet
```
